# Linksaver

This is the source code for an instant URL sharing site to change a complex URL to an easier word. 

You can move your important URL between devices without any login on the platform (google, SNS, memo app).

## Homepage

You can go to my page [here](https://morning-sands-67713.herokuapp.com/) to see the result of the code.

You can see another one [here](https://url-to-word.netlify.app/) to see implementation, but I don't have the code.

## Development

I developed it with Javascript, Sqlite3, Postgres DB, and Heroku.

## Usage

1. Type or copy&paste your URL in the upper input box, then enter.
2. Remember the word
3. Type word to bring your URL.
